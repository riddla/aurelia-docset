  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;As you begin to learn Aurelia and build applications, you may find that you need assistance from time to time. Sometimes it may only be an answer to a quick question or a clarification on the docs. Other times it may be a need for more extensive support, architectural advice or even consulting or training.&quot;,
